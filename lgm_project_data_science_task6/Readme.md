# Decision Tree Classification on Iris Flowers ML Project :

We are implementing decision tree classification algorithm on Iris dataset in this particular ML project .

## Description:

The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier,it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

## Modules and there usage:

#### a) Numpy:

We can use this module by including below:

```python
import numpy as np
```

#### b) Scikit-learn :

We can use this module by including below:

```python
from sklearn import datasets
```

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
```

```python
from sklearn import tree
```

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
```

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix,accuracy_score,classification_report

```

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

#### c) Pandas :

We can use this module by including below:

```python
import pandas as pd
```

#### d) Matplotlib :

We can use this module by including below:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

#### e) Seaborn :

We can use this module by including below:

```python
import seaborn as sns
```

```python
from seaborn import load_dataset
```
