# Iris Flowers Classification ML Project :

This particular ML project is usually referred to as the "Hello World" of Machine Learning.

## Description: 

The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit into memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.   

## Modules and there usage:
#### a) Basemap Matplotlib :

We can use this module by including below:
```python
import mpl_toolkits.mplot3d
```

#### b) Scikit-learn :

We can use this module by including below:
```python
from sklearn import datasets
```
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
```
```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
```

#### c) Pandas :

We can use this module by including below:
```python
import pandas as pd
```
#### d) Matplotlib :

We can use this module by including below:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
